He kept his discovery secret until 1680, when Robert Boyle rediscovered phosphorus and published his findings. The discovery of phosphorus helped to raise the question of what it meant for a substance to be an element. In 1661, Boyle defined an element as \"those primitive and simple Bodies of which the mixt ones are said to be composed, and into which they are ultimately resolved.\" Lavoisier's \"Trait\u00e9 \u00c9l\u00e9mentaire de Chimie\" (\"Elementary Treatise of Chemistry\"), which was written in 1789 and first translated into English by the writer Robert Kerr, is considered to be the first modern textbook\n\nDocument[2](Title: History of the periodic table)group having related properties. He termed these groups \"triads\". Definition of Triad law:-\"Chemically analogous elements arranged in increasing order of their atomic weights formed well marked groups of three called Triads in which the atomic weight of the middle element was found to be generally the arithmetic mean of the atomic weight of the other two elements in the triad. Alexandre-Emile B\u00e9guyer de Chancourtois, a French geologist, was the first person to notice the periodicity of the elements \u2014 similar elements occurring at regular intervals when they are ordered by their atomic weights. In 1862 he devised an early form\n\nDocument[3](Title: History of the periodic table)published his periodic table of the known elements, predicted new elements to help complete his table and corrected the atomic weights of some of the elements, Meyer published a virtually identical periodic table. Meyer and Mendeleev are considered by some historians of science to be the co-creators of the periodic table, but Mendeleev's accurate prediction of the qualities of undiscovered elements enables him to have the larger share of the credit. In 1864, the English chemist William Odling also drew up a table that was remarkably similar to the table produced by Mendeleev. Odling overcame the tellurium-iodine problem and even\n\n\nQuestion: who developed the first periodic table with 8 columns\nAnswer: ", "output": "There is no document that mentions the development of the first periodic table with ", "time": "5.876473"}
