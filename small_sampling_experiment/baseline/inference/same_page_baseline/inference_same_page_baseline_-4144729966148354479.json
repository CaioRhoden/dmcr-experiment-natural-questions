{"prompt": "Documents: \nDocument[0](Title: Spanish-American War)President McKinley , well aware of the political complexity surrounding the conflict , wanted to end the revolt peacefully . In accordance with this policy , McKinley began to negotiate with the Spanish government , hoping that the negotiations would be able to end the yellow journalism in the United States , and therefore , end the loudest calls to go to war with Spain . An attempt was made to negotiate a peace before McKinley took office , however , the Spanish refused to take part in the negotiations . In 1897 McKinley appointed Stewart L. Woodford as the new minister to Spain , who again offered to negotiate a peace . In October 1897 , the Spanish government still refused the United States offer to negotiate between the Spanish and the Cubans , but promised the US it would give the Cubans more autonomy . However , with the election of a more liberal Spanish government in November , Spain began to change their policies in Cuba . First , the new Spanish government told the United States that it was willing to offer a change in the Reconcentration policies ( the main set of policies that was feeding yellow journalism in the United States ) if the Cuban rebels agreed to a cessation of hostilities . This time the rebels refused the terms in hopes that continued conflict would lead to US intervention and the creation of an independent Cuba . The liberal Spanish government also recalled the Spanish Governor General Valeriano Weyler from Cuba . This action alarmed many Cubans loyal to Spain .\n\nDocument[1](Title: Spanish-American War)Spanish -- American War Part of the Philippine Revolution and the Cuban War of Independence Explosion of the USS Maine Date April 21 , 1898 -- August 13 , 1898 ( 3 months , 3 weeks and 2 days ) Location Cuba and Puerto Rico ( Caribbean Sea ) Philippines and Guam ( Asia - Pacific ) Result American victory Treaty of Paris of 1898 Territorial changes Spain relinquishes sovereignty over Cuba , cedes Puerto Rico , Guam and the Philippine Islands to the United States for $20 million Belligerents United States Cuban revolutionaries Filipino revolutionaries Spain Cuba Philippines Guam Puerto Rico Commanders and leaders William McKinley Nelson A.

With the German seizure of Tsingtao in 1897 , Dewey 's squadron had become the only naval force in the Far East without a local base of its own , and was beset with coal and ammunition problems . Despite these problems , the Asiatic Squadron not only destroyed the Spanish fleet but also captured the harbor of Manila .\n\nDocument[3](Title: Spanish-American War)The Spanish -- American War ( Spanish : Guerra hispano - americana or Guerra hispano - estadounidense ; Filipino : Digmaang Espanyol - Amerikano ) was fought between the United States and Spain in 1898 .
