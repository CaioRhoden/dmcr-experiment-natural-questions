In accordance with this policy , McKinley began to negotiate with the Spanish government , hoping that the negotiations would be able to end the yellow journalism in the United States , and therefore , end the loudest calls to go to war with Spain . An attempt was made to negotiate a peace before McKinley took office , however , the Spanish refused to take part in the negotiations . In 1897 McKinley appointed Stewart L. Woodford as the new minister to Spain , who again offered to negotiate a peace . In October 1897 , the Spanish government still refused the United States offer to negotiate between the Spanish and the Cubans , but promised the US it would give the Cubans more autonomy . However , with the election of a more liberal Spanish government in November , Spain began to change their policies in Cuba . First , the new Spanish government told the United States that it was willing to offer a change in the Reconcentration policies ( the main set of policies that was feeding yellow journalism in the United States ) if the Cuban rebels agreed to a cessation of hostilities . This time the rebels refused the terms in hopes that continued conflict would lead to US intervention and the creation of an independent Cuba . The liberal Spanish government also recalled the Spanish Governor General Valeriano Weyler from Cuba . This action alarmed many Cubans loyal to Spain .",Spanish-American War,20970748
