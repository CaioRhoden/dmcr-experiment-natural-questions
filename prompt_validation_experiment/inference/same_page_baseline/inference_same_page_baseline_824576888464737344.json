Movement is also a source of line, and blur can also create a reaction. Subject lines contribute to both mood and linear perspective, giving the viewer the illusion of depth. Oblique lines convey a sense of movement and angular lines generally convey a sense of dynamism and possibly tension. Lines can also direct attention towards the main subject of picture, or contribute to organization by dividing it into compartments. The artist may exaggerate or create lines perhaps as part of their message to the viewer.

In image A the 2 mountains are equally sized and positioned beside each other creating a very static and uninteresting image. In image B the mountains are differently sized and one is placed closer to the horizon, guiding the eye to move from one mountain to the other creating a more interesting and pleasing image. This also feels more natural because in nature objects are rarely the same size and evenly spaced. These principles \"can\" be means of a good composition yet they \"cannot\" be applied separately but should\n\nDocument[2](Title: Composition (visual arts))as the viewer associates them with softness. In photography, curved lines can give graduated shadows when paired with soft-directional lighting, which usually results in a very harmonious line structure within the image. There are three properties of color. Hue, brightness, and value. Hue is simply the name of a color, (red, yellow, and blue, etc.) Brightness refers to the intensity and strength of the color. The lightness and darkness to a color is the value. Color also has the ability to work within our emotions. Given that, we can use color to create mood. It can also be used as\n\nDocument[3](Title: Composition (visual arts))confused with the elements of art (or elements of design) themselves. For example, shape is an \"element\"; the usage of shape is characterized by various \"principles.\" Some principles of organization affecting the composition of a picture are: The position of the viewer can strongly influence the aesthetics of an image, even if the subject is entirely imaginary and viewed \"within the mind's eye\". Not only does it influence the elements within the picture, but it also influences the viewer's interpretation of the subject. For example, if a boy is photographed from above, perhaps from the eye level of an adult,\n\n\nQuestion: the organization of the formal elements in an art work\nAnswer: ", "output": "Organization of formal elements, principles like line movement,", "time": "1.934165"}
