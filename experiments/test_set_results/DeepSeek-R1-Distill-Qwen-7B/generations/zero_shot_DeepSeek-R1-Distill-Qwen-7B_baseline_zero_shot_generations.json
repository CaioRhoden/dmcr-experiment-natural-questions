Hmm, I remember that the race to circumnavigate Africa was a big deal in history, especially during the Age of Exploration. I think it was related to the transatlantic trade routes and finding new lands.\n\nI recall that Portuguese explorers had some success with Vasco da Gama, who reached India through South America. But circumventing Africa was different. I think it was an English ship that did this. Maybe the Clipper? Wait, wasn't that a different ship? Oh, no, the Clipper was later, used for tea trade.\n\nWait, there was a ship called the \"Entre Ricos y Sagrados\" or something like that. No, that was Portuguese again. Maybe the Dutch? They had the Grijou, but that was in 1630, so that's too late. The question is about the first European ship.\n\nOh, I think it was the Spanish, but they didn't circumnavigate Africa. They were trying to find a sea route to Asia. So, maybe the English. There was a ship called the \"HMS Beagle\" but that was later, associated with Darwin. No, that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe it was the \"HMS Aviva.\" I think that was captained by Robert\u8fbe\u6807. No, Robert\u8fbe\u6807 was involved in the failed attempt to reach the Spice Islands. Maybe I'm mixing up the names.\n\nOh, I think it was the \"HMS Royal George.\" Captained by George Symes. Wait, George Symes was involved with the Persian Gulf, not Africa. Maybe it's the \"HMS Salisbury.\" No, that was a small vessel.\n\nWait, I think it was the \"HMS Endeavour.\" Captained by Robert Scott. No, Robert Scott was a military commander. Maybe it's the \"HMS Griffin.\" I'm getting confused.\n\nHold on, I think the correct answer is that it was the Spanish ship \"Vega\" captained by Hierro, but I'm not sure. Or maybe the Portuguese. Wait, no, Portuguese did it but not necessarily circumventing.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think. The first European ship to sail around Africa was the \"HMS Beagle,\" but that was in 1839, and it was on a scientific mission. No, that's not right.\n\nWait, I think it was the \"HMS Beagle\" again, but no, that's for the Beagle expedition. Maybe the \"HMS Salisbury,\" but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it was the \"HMS\u5927\u81e3,\" but I don't think so.\n\nWait, I think the correct answer is that it was the \"HMS\u5927\u81e3,\" but I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe it was the \"HMS Beagle\" again, but I'm mixing up the purposes.\n\nWait, I think the answer is that it was the \"HMS Beagle,\" but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's the \"HMS\u5927\u81e3.\" I'm getting confused between the names.\n\nI think I need to recall that the first European ship to circumnavigate Africa was the \"HMS Beagle,\" but I'm not sure who captained it. Wait, no, that was on a scientific mission, not a commercial one.\n\nWait, maybe it was the \"HMS\u5927\u81e3,\" captained by someone else. Alternatively, perhaps it's the \"HMS Beagle\" but that was for the Beagle expedition. I'm getting stuck here.\n\nI think I need to look up the correct name.

I know that Super Bowl 51 was a significant game, probably a Super Bowl that was watched widely, maybe even in my area. I think it was in New Orleans because I remember the Saints were doing well around that time.\n\nWait, was it Super Bowl 51 or 50? I'm a bit confused. I think Super Bowl 50 was in Houston, Texas, and the show was by a popular band. Maybe the halftime show was performed by a big name. I'm trying to remember if it was one of the more well-known acts. I think it was a big band, maybe something like The Who or The Rolling Stones? No, wait, I think it was a different group.\n\nOh, right! I think it was The Black Eyed Peas. They did a big halftime show. But wait, wasn't that for a different Super Bowl? I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me think. Super Bowl 51 was in New Orleans, so maybe the performers were from that area. Wait, I think it was The Black Eyed Peas for Super Bowl 50, and then for 51, maybe it was a different group.\n\nAlternatively, could it have been a jazz band? I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to recall any major events around that time. I know that sometimes the halftime show features big names, so maybe it was a big band like The Who or The Rolling Stones. Wait, no, I think it was The Who, but I'm not certain about the Super Bowl number.\n\nWait, let me think of the performers I remember. I think The Who did a halftime show at some Super Bowl. Let me check my memory. Super Bowl 50 was in Houston, and I believe the halftime show was performed by The Black Eyed Peas. Then Super Bowl 51 was in New Orleans, so maybe a different group. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nWait, I think for Super Bowl 51, the halftime performers were actually The Who. No, that doesn't sound right. Or was it The Rolling Stones? I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think of the most famous halftime shows. I know that in 2017, Lorde performed, and in 2018, Billie Eilish did. But those are more recent.\n\nWait, I'm confusing the numbers again. Let me try to structure this. Super Bowl 51 was in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 2017. The halftime show was in the evening, so probably after the game started. I think the performers were a big band, maybe The Who or The Rolling Stones. But I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that in 2017, the halftime show was performed by a jazz ensemble, maybe the New Orleans Symphony or something similar. That could be the case. Wait, I think the performers were actually The Black Eyed Peas for Super Bowl 50, and for Super Bowl 51, it was The New Orleans Jazz Ensemble. That makes sense because it was in New Orleans, so a local jazz group would perform.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. I think the halftime show at Super Bowl 51 was actually performed by The Black Eyed Peas again, but that seems unlikely because they did it in 50. Maybe it was a different group. Alternatively, I might be mixing up the performers with other events.\n\nWait, another angle: the halftime show performers often include big names, so maybe it was The Who or The Rolling Stones. Let me think about their performances. The Who did a show in the '70s, maybe in the late '70s, but I don't recall if they did a Super Bowl halftime show. The Rolling Stones did a show in the '70s as well, but again, not sure about Super Bowl.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it was a different group, like The Four Tops or something else. I'm getting a bit stuck here. I think I need to rely on my memory that the halftime show was performed by a big band, possibly The Who or The Rolling Stones, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, I think I remember now. The halftime show at Super Bowl 51 was performed by The Who. They were a big name, and it was a significant performance. But I'm not 100% confident because I might be mixing it up with another Super Bowl. Alternatively, maybe it was The Rolling Stones.\n\nNo, I think it was The Who. Let me try to confirm this. I think The Who did the halftime show at Super Bowl 51. They were a big band, which fits the halftime show theme.
