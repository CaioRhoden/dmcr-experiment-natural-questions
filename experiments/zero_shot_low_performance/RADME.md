# zero_shot_low_performance

**Objective**: Investigate the Datamodels re-ranking for samples especially bad at the zero-shot. We aim to understand the possible gain that the context can retrieve and how the Datamodels can help in its enrichment.

**Setup**: The zero-shot will be analyzed for the Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct and Qwen-8B model with context-size of 16. 


**Folder organization**:

**Results**: TODO
