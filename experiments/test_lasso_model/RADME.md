# test_lasso_model

**Objective**: Compare the performance of the datamodels as re-ranking context tool when usiing a Lasso Linear Regressor as the model estimating importance through the weights. 

**Setup**: The setup of test wil be different L1 lambdas [0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001] represented through the identification from 1 to 4. All the other parameters, both for the LLM and the linear regression, will be fixed and can be found in the table below. The LLM model will be the Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct.


**Folder organization**: We will have 6 differents folders containing each one a pipeline to achieve the results

**Results**: TODO

[TODO: Add parameters table]
