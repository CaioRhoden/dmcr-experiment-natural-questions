From 1659 to 1661 it was extended to the north by the addition of the Théâtre des Tuileries . From 1664 to 1666 the architect Louis Le Vau and his assistant François d'Orbay made other significant changes . They transformed Philibert de l'Orme's facades and central pavilion , replacing its grand central staircase with a colonnaded vestibule on the ground floor and the Salle des Cents Suisses ( Hall of the Hundred Swiss Guards ) on the floor above and adding a rectangular dome . A new grand staircase was installed in the entrance of the north wing of the palace , and lavishly decorated royal apartments were constructed in the south wing . The king 's rooms were on the ground floor , facing toward the Louvre , and the queen 's on the floor above , overlooking the garden . At the same time , Louis ' gardener , André Le Nôtre , redesigned the Tuileries gardens . The Court moved into the Tuileries Palace in November 1667 , but left in 1672 , and soon thereafter went to the Palace of Versailles . The Tuileries Palace was virtually abandoned and used only as a theatre , but its gardens became a fashionable resort of Parisians .",20971524
