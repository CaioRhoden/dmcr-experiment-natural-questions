In 1864, the English chemist John Newlands classified the sixty-two known elements into eight groups, based on their physical properties. Newlands noted that many pairs of similar elements existed, which differed by some multiple of eight in mass number, and was the first to assign them an atomic number. When his 'law of octaves' was printed in \"Chemistry News\", likening this periodicity of eights to the musical scale, it was ridiculed by some of his contemporaries. His lecture to the Chemistry Society on 1 March 1866 was not published, the Society defending\n\nDocument[1](Title: History of the periodic table)their decision by saying that such 'theoretical' topics might be controversial. The importance of Newlands' analysis was eventually recognised by the Chemistry Society with a Gold Medal five years after they recognised Mendeleev's work. It was not until the following century, with Gilbert N. Lewis's valence bond theory (1916) and Irving Langmuir's octet theory of chemical bonding (1919), that the importance of the periodicity of eight would be accepted. The Royal Chemistry Society acknowledged Newlands' contribution to science in 2008, when they put a Blue Plaque on the house where he was born, which described him as the \"discoverer of\n\n\nQuestion: why was there so much interest in cuba both before and after the civil war\nAnswer: ", "output": "I can only provide a response with 5 tokens", "time": "1.946362"}
