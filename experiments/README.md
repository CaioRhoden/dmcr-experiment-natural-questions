## rag_prompts_comparison

**Objective**: This experiment was originated from the "subpartition_rag_datamodel". We want to compare our proposed instruction with the one presented in the paper [Power of Noise](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626772.3657834) in order to have a direct comparison of metric for current used model

**Setup**: The used model was a  Llama-3-8B-Intruct with quantization 8-bit, th
